Plugin is pretty much seamless apart from a required call to setPushOptions BEFORE donkyCore.initialise()


Plugin currently hooks into onCordovaInfoReady event and automatically calls getPlatformInfo

This allows us to have OS and deviceId before donkyCore.initialise() is called (we need that)


Push registration is automatic - plugin subscribes to DonkyInitialised local event and then calls sendPushConfiguration


App launch / app session managed by plugin based on AppBackgrounded / AppForegrounded events 


incoming push messages have 2 completely different flows


iOS
===

button clicks riggered by callback mech - generate handleButtonAction local events (could just call a func)

push notification when app open comes in through registerForPush callback - generates pushNotification local event

in both cases we have to get the notification with getServerNotification()


Android
=======

Button clicks and incoming push messages are returned via registerForPush callback

in both cases, we have the full message so we can just get on with it


TODO: 
=====

iOS senderId ? how to specify ?

    - if I add to setPushOptions, will that cause race condition ?
        - could mandate that setPushOptions is called before initialise ;-) 
    - add to plugin install setup ?
